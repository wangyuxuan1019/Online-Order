# Online-Order
A Spring and Hibernate based online food ordering system  
  
•	Implemented Rest API via Spring MVC including registration, menu searching and ordering, checkout etc.  
•	Utilized Hibernate to access and operate the data storage (menu, restaurants etc.)  
•	Provided both authentication and authorization via Spring security to protect the application from malicious attacks.  
•	Used the Spring framework core technologies to loosely decouple all the components in the application.
